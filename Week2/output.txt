'''
    This code defines a function called absolute_square that takes in two parameters: num1 and num2.
    The function calculates the absolute difference between num1 and num2, squares the result, and returns it.

def absolute_square(num1, num2):
    # Calculate the absolute difference between num1 and num2
    result = abs(num1 - num2)
    
    # Square the result
    result *= result
    
    # Return the squared result
    return result
